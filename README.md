<h1>About:</h1>
This is a game made in 2 weeks for the 2024 "Daedalus: The Nightmare Before Christmas" Hackathon, As well as the winner for the Winter Track! In this project, I learned to use Godot/GDScript and Aseprite to
create art and make a functional game! If you would like to play it just go <a href="https://mrcookienub.itch.io/christmas-rush">here!</a>
